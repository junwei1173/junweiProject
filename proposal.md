# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Music player.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A music player that lets you play through song files.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

A music player UI with a search function, a progress bar, play back controls like play, pause, stop, skip, and previous buttons. A volume control slider to adjust the audio. Shuffle and repeat options. The player will also show which songs are currently playing.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Not applicable.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Able to play music files and the buttons working correctly.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A working and accurate search function.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

An eye-catching user interface with all the functions working correctly.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to learn how to use tkinter for the UI and pygame for the audio play back controls. I also need to come up with a design for my UI to make it more unique. I will need to research how to make a music player with python (language I’m using).
